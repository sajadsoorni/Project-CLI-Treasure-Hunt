I completed the CLI Treasure Hunt project and learned a lot about using the command line effectively😍 I practiced creating lists, managing directories, and writing to files using terminal commands. It was a fun and engaging game that helped solidify my understanding of how to interact with my computer through the command line.

I have found the answers and recorded them in Answer/answer.txt using the command line.

Thank you to the CodeYourFuture team for this valuable experience🙏
